        <h2>About her</h2>
        <p>We are both best friends. Amira is not just a friend, she is like family to me. She has filled the gap of not having my family around. She is always supportive, lights up my path, and keeps me away from mistakes. Shes is always there for me and has never abandoned me, no matter what. She is my first defender. She means everything to me. It is rare to find friends who do this, so I love her very much."
